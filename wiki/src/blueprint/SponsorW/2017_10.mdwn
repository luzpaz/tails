# A. VeraCrypt support in GNOME

## A.1 Research user needs and development costs

- **User needs**:

  - We installed [*LimeSurvey* on our infrastructure](https://survey.tails.boum.org).

  - We created a draft survey and refined it after conducting two pilot
    tests with *VeraCrypt* users.

  - We advertised the final survey from the homepage of *Tor Browser* in
    Tails on October 17:

  - Our users have been [very responsive to our
    call](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2017-October/003505.html)
    and since then we have gathered 30 complete answers to the survey each
    day on average, reaching 375 in total on October 30.

# B. Additional software

We started to work on issues that need to be solved before the UX design
sprint ([[!tails_ticket 9059]], [[!tails_ticket 6038]]).

# C. Deliver new features
